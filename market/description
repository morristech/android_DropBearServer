[Overview]

This is a SSH server, based on DropBear.
It allows you to easily install, configure and run a Secured SHell on your Android phone.
SSH is a secured (encrypted) protocol that is used on millions of GNU/Linux servers to issue commands remotely.

This is an Open-Source software released under the GNU GPLv2+.
Review its code at GitHub: https://github.com/shkschneider/android_DropBearServer

[Attention]

THIS REQUIRES ROOT PERMISSIONS
If you don't know what 'root', 'ssh' or 'public key' means, you probably don't need this!

WRITING PROBLEMS ON SDCARDS
Please read <http://www.chainfire.eu/articles/113/Is_Google_blocking_apps_writing_to_SD_cards_/>
This problem occurs on some devices with multiple sdcard, and cannot be fixed from the application's side for now...

[Features]

* You will be able to gain shell access, just like 'adb shell'
* You will be able to put/pull files via 'scp' or similar

This rich front-end to DropBear allows you to easily configure tons of things:

* Allows full root access (optional)
* Allows non-root access (sdcard read/write)
* Installs DropBear
* Starts/Stops the server
* Manage credentials (publickeys or master password)
* Loads public keys from SDCard

Now you will have full control of your device!

[Will It Conflict With Other Binaries]

Up to version 1.7, it might.
From 1.8 and up, it won't :)
